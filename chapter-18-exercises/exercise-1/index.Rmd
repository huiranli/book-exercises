## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## This is my Report

This is the code we will look at in class. This is just plain old Markdown that lets you render text in **bold** or _italics_. However, you can put in a block of R code, and the document will show the code and the results!

library(knitter)
I like writing **report**
```{r example, echo = FALSE}
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers) # get the mean
```
the mean of teh mumbers happen to be **'r numbers_mean'**.
img_url <- "https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2018/10/puppies-cover.jpg"

img_markdown <- paste ("![puppies](",img_url,")")
```{r other_chunk, echo = FALSE}
print(numbers)
```
